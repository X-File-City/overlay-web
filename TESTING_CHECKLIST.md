# Stripe Subscription Testing Checklist

## Prerequisites

### 1. Start Stripe CLI for Webhook Forwarding

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
# Login to Stripe CLI (if not already)
stripe login

# Forward webhooks to local Next.js app
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
```

**Copy the webhook signing secret** from the CLI output (starts with `whsec_`) and update `.env.local`:

```bash
# In overlay-landing/.env.local
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_CLI_SECRET_HERE
```

### 2. Start the Landing Page Dev Server

```bash
cd overlay-landing
npm run dev
```

### 3. Start the Desktop App

```bash
cd .. # back to overlay root
npm run dev
```

### 4. Sign into Desktop App
- Make sure you're signed in to the desktop app with WorkOS

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... (production webhook secret)
```
