# Dawn Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** January 23, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Dawn ("Dawn," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, discloses, and protects information when you use the Dawn desktop application (the "App") and related services (the "Services").

**BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND AGREE TO THE COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED HEREIN.**

---

## 1. Summary (Plain Language Overview)

**We believe in transparency.** Here's the key information in plain language:

| What | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Local-first content** | We do **NOT** collect or store the content of your notes, chats, transcriptions, or browser usage. That content stays on your device. |
| **What we collect** | Authentication data (email), and in the future, anonymous usage counts (not content). |
| **BYO API keys** | When you use your own API keys, your data goes directly to the third-party provider (e.g., Groq, OpenAI)—we never see it. |
| **We don't sell data** | We do not sell your personal information. Period. |

---

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Account and Authentication Information

During onboarding and authentication, we collect:
- **Email address** and/or authentication identifiers (depending on login method)
- **Account metadata** (e.g., account creation date, last login timestamp)
- **Authentication tokens** (securely stored for session management)

### 2.2 Usage Analytics (Current and Future)

**Currently collected:**
- Basic authentication events (sign-in, sign-out)

**May be collected in the future** (non-content metrics only):
- **Feature usage counts:**
  - Number of transcriptions and smart transcriptions performed
  - Number of notes created (count only, not content)
  - Number of chat sessions or messages sent (count only, not content)
  - Overlay invocation counts (notes/chat/browser panels)
- **Feature engagement:**
  - Features enabled (hotkeys, auto-start, etc.)
  - Model/provider selection (e.g., "OpenAI" vs "Groq"—without prompts or outputs)
- **Funnel and activation metrics:**
  - Install → onboarding completion → first feature usage
  - Time-to-first-value measurements
- **Engagement metrics:**
  - Session counts and duration (coarse time buckets, not precise timestamps)
  - Daily/weekly active usage indicators
- **Performance telemetry:**
  - Transcription latency (bucketed ranges: p50/p95)
  - UI responsiveness metrics (frame drops, CPU usage buckets)
  - Crash-free session rates

**IMPORTANT:** We collect **event counts and timestamps only**—never the actual text, audio, or content of your transcriptions, notes, chats, or browsing activity.

### 2.3 Device and Technical Information

To operate and improve the Services, we may collect:
- **App version** and build number
- **Operating system** type and version
- **Device type** and hardware identifiers (anonymized where possible)
- **Language and locale** settings
- **Network type** (Wi-Fi, cellular—not specific network names)

### 2.4 Diagnostic and Crash Data

To maintain service reliability, we may collect:
- **Crash reports** and stack traces (automatically redacted to remove personal data)
- **Error codes** and error messages (technical codes only)
- **Performance logs** (response times, failure rates)

**Automatic redaction:** Our crash reporting is configured to redact:
- API keys and authentication tokens
- User-entered text and content
- File paths that might reveal usernames or personal directories

### 2.5 Security-Related Information

For account security and fraud prevention, we may collect:
- **IP address** (retained briefly, used only for security purposes)
- **Login timestamps** and patterns (for anomaly detection)
- **Device fingerprint** information (for suspicious login detection)

This information is used **solely for security purposes** (preventing unauthorized access, detecting fraudulent activity) and is retained only as long as necessary for these purposes.

### 2.6 Information You Provide Voluntarily

If you contact us for support or provide feedback, we collect:
- Your email address and name (if provided)
- The content of your communications
- Any attachments or screenshots you choose to share

### 2.7 Payment Information (Future)

If we introduce paid subscriptions:
- We will use a third-party payment processor (e.g., Stripe)
- We will **never** store raw credit card numbers or full payment details
- We may receive limited information from the processor (last 4 digits, expiration date, billing address) for records and support purposes

---

## 3. Information We Do NOT Collect

**We are committed to a local-first, privacy-respecting architecture.** We do **NOT** collect, store, or have access to:

-  **Content of your notes** (text, formatting, attachments)
-  **Content of your chats** (messages, prompts, AI responses)
-  **Content of your transcriptions** (audio, transcribed text)
-  **Content of your browser activity** (URLs visited, page content, browsing history)
-  **Keystrokes or keyboard input**
-  **Screen contents or screenshots** (unless you explicitly share them with support)
-  **Microphone audio** (beyond real-time processing for transcription, which occurs locally or is sent directly to your chosen third-party provider)
-  **Your API keys** (these are stored locally on your device only)

**Note:** If we ever introduce features that require collecting content data, we will:
1. Update this Privacy Policy with clear disclosure
2. Provide prominent notice to users
3. Obtain affirmative consent where required by law
