              <p className="text-[#0a0a0a] font-medium mb-8">
                BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, ACCESSING, OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE SERVICES.
              </p>

              <Section title="1. Who We Are">
                <p>The Services are provided by Overlay.</p>
                <p>Contact: <strong>work.dslalwani@gmail.com</strong></p>
              </Section>

              <Section title="2. Eligibility">
                <p>You must be at least <strong>13 years old</strong> to use the Services. If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you may use the Services only with the consent of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms on your behalf.</p>
                <p>By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you meet these eligibility requirements.</p>
              </Section>

              <Section title="3. Description of the Services">
                <p>Overlay provides an OS-level overlay application that may include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Speech-to-text transcription</strong> (basic and &quot;smart&quot; transcription with AI-powered formatting)</li>
                  <li><strong>AI-powered chat</strong> functionality</li>
                  <li><strong>Local notes</strong> creation and management</li>
                  <li><strong>Local browsing panels</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Overlay interfaces</strong> for quick access to features</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 className="text-[#0a0a0a] font-medium mt-6 mb-3">3.1 Local-First Architecture</h4>
                <p><strong>By design, the Services operate on a local-first principle.</strong> This means:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The <strong>content</strong> of your notes, chats, and browser usage (including page content, URLs visited, and any text you enter) <strong>remains stored locally on your device</strong>.</li>
                  <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect, transmit, or store this content on our servers.</li>
                  <li>Your local data is your responsibility to back up and secure.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 className="text-[#0a0a0a] font-medium mt-6 mb-3">3.2 Third-Party AI Services</h4>
                <p>Certain features (transcription, smart transcription, AI chat) rely on third-party AI providers. When you use these features:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Your <strong>input data</strong> (audio for transcription, text prompts for chat) <strong>is transmitted directly to the third-party provider</strong> to process your request.</li>
                  <li>This transmission occurs <strong>between your device and the third-party provider</strong>—Overlay does not store or have access to this data in transit or after processing.</li>
                  <li>The third-party provider&apos;s terms and privacy policies govern their handling of your data.</li>
                </ul>
              </Section>

              <Section title="4. Accounts and Authentication">
                <h4 className="text-[#0a0a0a] font-medium mb-3">4.1 Account Creation</h4>
                <p>You may be required to authenticate during onboarding. You agree to:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration</li>
                  <li>Maintain and promptly update your account information</li>
                  <li>Maintain the security and confidentiality of your login credentials</li>
                  <li>Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 className="text-[#0a0a0a] font-medium mt-6 mb-3">4.2 Account Responsibility</h4>
                <p>You are solely responsible for all activity that occurs under your account, whether or not you authorized such activity. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this section.</p>
              </Section>

              <Section title="5. Bring Your Own API Key (BYO Key) Model">
                <h4 className="text-[#0a0a0a] font-medium mb-3">5.1 Current Model</h4>
                <p>Currently, certain features of the Services require you to provide your own API keys from third-party service providers (such as Groq, OpenAI, Google, or other AI/transcription providers).</p>

                <h4 className="text-[#0a0a0a] font-medium mt-6 mb-3">5.2 Your Responsibilities</h4>
                <p>When using the BYO Key model:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>You are solely responsible</strong> for obtaining, maintaining, and securing your API keys.</li>
                  <li><strong>You are solely responsible</strong> for any charges, fees, or costs incurred through your use of third-party APIs.</li>
                  <li><strong>You must comply</strong> with the third-party provider&apos;s terms of service, acceptable use policies, and usage limits.</li>
                  <li><strong>You acknowledge</strong> that your API keys may be stored locally on your device for functionality purposes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 className="text-[#0a0a0a] font-medium mt-6 mb-3">5.3 Third-Party Terms</h4>
                <p>Your use of any third-party services through the App is governed by that third party&apos;s terms of service and privacy policy, <strong>not</strong> by these Terms.</p>

                <h4 className="text-[#0a0a0a] font-medium mt-6 mb-3">5.4 Future Subscription Model</h4>
                <p>We may introduce subscription plans in the future that provide managed API access, removing the need for BYO keys. If introduced, such subscriptions will be subject to additional terms.</p>
              </Section>

              <Section title="6. AI-Generated Content Disclaimer">
                <h4 className="text-[#0a0a0a] font-medium mb-3">6.1 No Guarantee of Accuracy</h4>
                <p>The Services may utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning models provided by third parties. <strong>AI-generated outputs (including but not limited to transcriptions, smart transcriptions, and chat responses) may be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, biased, or inappropriate.</strong></p>

                <h4 className="text-[#0a0a0a] font-medium mt-6 mb-3">6.2 Your Responsibility</h4>

                  <li><strong>AI outputs do not constitute</strong> professional advice of any kind (medical, legal, financial, psychological, or otherwise).</li>
                  <li><strong>Overlay is not responsible</strong> for the quality, accuracy, or appropriateness of any AI-generated content.</li>
